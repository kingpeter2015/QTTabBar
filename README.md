# QTTabBar Tabs for Windows Explorer
**This project is a fork of the orignal QTTabBar from [Quizo, Paul Accisano aka masamunexgp](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qttabbar/) and in no means the original project**
This fork was created since the original code wasn't updated since 2012 and some bugs where really annoying, aiming to fix at least those.

This project is getting ported to Visual Studio 2015 and should be run as Administrator to allow the hooks needed for building it.


Contributors are welcome since there are currently no "native" C# programers working on it.
